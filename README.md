# Asterism

Image reduction / pre-processing

Asterism is a Linux image data reduction preprocessing utility, written in Bash. Mainly, with amateur astronomical RAW image data in mind. Not to restrict its application, Asterism may be used to process macro and microscopy images. 

Asterism uses image manipulation programs common to most Linux distributions and various third party scripts to create a processing pipeline. DCRAW ImageMagick and Panotools must be installed - Hugin and Macrofusion are optional.

Primarily intented for RAW image data acquired with consumer digital cameras, Asterism handles fits tiff png jpeg and many other image formats. 

A user manual is available at http://synergous.com/txtpat/files/asterism_user_manual_new.html
RAW files are available to download from Dropbox to experiment with Asterism - three of each, bias dark, flat and light frames, ~10mb each.
