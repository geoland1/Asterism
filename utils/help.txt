NOTES - Installation and running Asterism

1. The programs yad dcraw imagemagick and hugin-tools must be installed - hugin macrofusion and enfuse are optional.

2. Download the source asterism.zip file and extract the Asterism folder to the user's home directory (e.g., with an archive manager)

3. Optional - open the Asterism folder and run SETUP - create an applications menu entry and / or desktop link / icon; or

4. Launch Asterism with RUN; alternatively if you don't want to run binaries

5. open a terminal in the Asterism folder and type 'bash -x ./asterism' Enter - without the quotes 

	Note: open a terminal anywhere and cd into the Asterism folder or type the path to asterism - ~/Asterism/asterism

	Note: use SETUP to remove the menu entry and / or desktop link

0.1.0.2

Added Develop process

PMStack update 

0.1.0.1

Added animated histogram inspector - it produces RGB or monochrome histograms to view in a loop press space bar or reverse to step through - testiing at this stage. 

0.1.0.0

Master frame section rewritten - there was a long term glitch in the selection of defect map that went undetected for months

Note: the default image calibration priority remains master bias and master flat regardless of the selection of defect map or master dark. To avoid this behaviour and to use a defect map 'do not' select create or select a master bias. The same applies to the use of dark frames. Asterism will exclude both master dark and defect map.

Note: Previous behaviour was to prioritise master frame selection based on noise evaluation - for example, super-bias over median and median over mean combined master frames. This behaviour still exists - Asterism always selects the best master frame unless a master frame is selected explicitly.
